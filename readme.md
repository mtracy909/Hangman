# Project Title: Hangman

A program to play hangman in Rust


## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Cd into the src folder
2. Open a terminal and type "rustc main.rs" and eter
3. On the next line, type ".\main" and enter

Instructions for using the software:

1. Type in a single letter as a guess
2. Guess until you win or run out of lives
3. Enter whether you would like to play again

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* VsCode
* Rust (check with "rustc --verion")

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Geeks for Geeks - Rust Basics](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rust/rust-basics/)
* [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html)
* [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Disallow users to input multiple letters at once (if they do so, the first letter is taken as their guess)
* [ ] Connect the game to a dictionary and randomize the word
